    <h2>Proposition: Does the race of a Police Officer have an impact on the number of Complaints Filed Against Them</h2>

      <h3>Race of the Police Officer has an impact on complaints filed against them</h3>

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The first design decision that I went for here was an overload of information. I wasn't sure when I started this visualization whether it was true that race had an impact, so this side was harder for me to argue for. I thought by providing a lot of information, the viewer was less likely to ask "what's missing" which was exactly what I was going for. I wanted to overload the viewer with data that shows that complaints against White officers are higher than those of other races. I especially wanted to highlight that black people are more likely to complain about white officers than officers of other races. I am trying to get the viewer to not ask the question "What percent of the police force is white". I would give this a -1 for deception. It certainly is deceptive not to include total counts of white police officers but all the information shown is true. Perhaps for next time it would have been a stronger argument if I could have included race proportions of the entire NYPD in a way that was convincing for this side, but I couldn't figure it out.</li>
								<p></p>

				<li>The next thing that I did was exclude "Null" and "Unknown" from my data for the Complainee Race and group "American Indian", "Asian", and "Other" together. This was also relatively deceptive, maybe a value of -1. I would say that grouping American Indian, Asian, and Other together was relatively neutral, with maybe even a value of 0. It simply cleaned up the data to make it easier to digest the other groups. However, removing Null and Unknown was very deceptive. Nowhere did I state that these categories existed, and nowhere did I flag that the dataset was not complete. I found that by deleting these categories the thesis I was drawing was clearer. That there is some predjudice from people who complain about cops and that white cops were more commonly complained about than cops of color. Therefore the race of the cop does matter in terms of the number of complaints that they got. I am interested in understanding how people usually deal with excluding things in a less deceptive way. Is it called out in the caption?  </li>
								<p></p>

				<li>Lastly, I decided to use different types of graphs in this visualization. This is similar to what I spoke about as my first point, but its more complicated than just overwhleming the reader. It is about seeming like I have explored every angle. I show that by percent, Black NYC residents complain about cops more. I showed that cumulatively white officers receive the most complaints. I created two pie charts around complaints by officer rates and complaints by complainee rates. I think combining all of these make it seem like the viewer has the complete picture, when in fact, they don't. I would give this a score of -.5, since nothing here is blatantly untrue, its just not the full story. I also found for this visualization, I focused on optics. I made it prettier, and focused on using clear labels and design choices (colors to match legends, thick borders), to make it seem like a more formalized argument.</li>

      <h3>Race of the Police Officer does not have an impact on complaints filed against them</h3>

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The first design decision, and the main rationale for this visualization, was to show that the counts of complaints by race are in line with the total percentage of officers of that race. I did this by using two bar charts aligned next to each other. Therefore the natural inclination is to look at the chart and assume that it is fair that white officers have proportionally the same number of complaints as there are white officers on the force. While this is good reasoning, there are numerous deceptive factors at play. The first is that when you look at two charts next to each other, even if they appear to be formatted the same, you have no idea the magnitude differences, specifically when one is a percent and one is a raw total. It is also easy to drag the corners on the graph so they are slightly different sizes, but the bars look identical. For this I would give a deception score of -1.5. Tableau makes it very easy to resize graphs to tell the story you want to tell. </li>
				<p></p>
				<li>The second design decision was to use a percent total for one and a cumulative total for the second. I would give this a deception score of -0.5. While when you compare apples to apples (percents to percents) the graphs look similar, there is a slightly bigger gap then when you compare raw numbers. To make it seem like they are even more correlated, I used percents for one and raw sums for the other. Additionally, viewers can be confused by percents, and are perhaps more likely to trust what is going on in. I wanted this to be a simple visualization, as the argument is stronger if it doesn't seem like any trickery or complex calculations occuring.</li>
				<p></p>

				<li>The last deception is a big one. I would maybe give it a -2 on the score of deception. This deception has to do with the race breakdown of officers. The reason that it is deceptive is that it makes it seem like the race breakdown is accurate, and in fact it is accurate and 100% true based on the data we were given, but there is a hidden catch. This is just the racial breakdown of the officers that have had complaints filed against them, not total officers in the NYPD. You wouldn't know that from looking at the chart, because you would have to have information on where the data came from. For officers that have complaints against them, the complaints are roughly correlated by race, but extrapolating that to the entire NYPD, since many officers have never received complaints, is a huge can of worms. I think this would be very hard to spot, as I was intentional with my wording on titles and access to never outright lie (by saying things like all, or the entire NYPD), but it was heavily implied. </li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p> I was a bit worried when I started this assignment that by focusing on race I was going to break the groundrules of choosing something that demeaned or demoralized people. But I do think that complaints about police have histrorically had racial undertones and that it is a very important and prevalent problem to discuss in our society. I also thought that looking at data for a question like this was important because it happens everyday in our media. I did not intend to dehumanize police officers in any way shape of form, and I want to be clear about that up front. I think these are important conversations to have, both in a classroom setting and in the media. </p>

      <p>The hardest part of this whole process was actually deciding which side of the proposition the data supported, and which part I believed. Going in, I assumed the data would show that police officer complaint rate is impacted by race, which we know to be true for folks who are detained by the police. However, as I dug into this further, I realized how I framed the visualization had just as much influence as the numbers themselves. It was surprisingly easy to make a persuasive case either way just by choosing what to highlight, what to downplay, and how to structure the charts. That was both fascinating and a little unsettling—small design choices had a huge impact on how convincing each argument felt. I actually ended up believing that police officer race did not have much to do with the proportional number of complaints, which was surprising! </p>

			<p>This all definitely made me rethink what it means to create an “ethical” visualization. I used to think the line between persuasion and deception was clear, but now I see it’s more of a sliding scale. Some persuasive techniques, like emphasizing certain trends, feel reasonable, while others—like manipulating axes or omitting certain groups without stating that you did—push into misleading territory. The key difference, I think, is whether the viewer still has enough information to make their own judgment. Ethical visualization doesn’t mean stripping away all persuasion, but it does mean making sure people can see the full picture if they look closely. I think I toed this line, but some of my decisions went too far. Which I suppose was the whole goal of the assingment!</p>
