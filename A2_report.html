			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			The below were my original questions when reading, I updated them because we didn’t have the correct data on where illegal zoning occurred. 

			<ol>
				<li><b>What is the correlation between the number of houses that are illegal by zoning laws and the density of housing within a city? That is to say, are cities that are zoned illegally actually providing the most housing equity? </b> The motivation for this question was from the reading and realizing that Somerville only has 22 properties that actually meet zoning requirements. This led me to wonder whether cities that follow zoning laws better are actually more likely to be zoned in a way that exacerbates housing inequities and low supply. It would be super interesting to see how we can visualize these two things </li>

				<li><b>Do richer areas tend to have more or less zoning exemptions? </b> On the one hand I would expect areas where median income is high to have the most exceptions, since people with more money often have more capital to get around zoning laws, but I also have a theory that denser areas are poorer and are more likely to not meet zoning standards (as was discussed in the article about somerville that I read). It would be interesting to see if wealth is bending the rules in a way that only benefits the wealthy!</li>

				<li><b>How much available housing could we create by rezoning areas of a city that are currently zoned for things other than housing?</b> This question doesn’t come from the reading I read, but instead my life growing up in the Boston area. Housing insecurity has always been on the forefront of my mind, and as I got older it became clearer how out of sync this city is with the needs of its population. I grew up with friends talking about the need to stay poor to qualify for section 8 housing, because if they made too much money they couldn’t afford to live here.  Since COVID, Boston, like most major cities, has struggled with empty office and laboratory space. We are now in a unique position where we have the opportunity to rezone these areas and allow housing. While transitioning office space into residential housing isn’t cheap, I believe it is necessary and wanted to understand how much additional housing we could generate</li>
			</ol>
			New Questions that can be answered with existing data sets
			<ol>
				<li><b>Does single-family zoning actually reduce housing density, or is it just another way to restrict housing supply?</b> One of the biggest takeaways from the reading was just how much land is locked into single-family zoning, even in places where housing demand is through the roof. If so much land is reserved for single-family homes, it makes me wonder—are these areas actually less dense, or are they just forcing housing scarcity? If we could visualize how single-family zoning correlates with population density, we might get a better sense of whether this type of zoning is really doing what it claims or if it’s just a tool to keep housing supply low.</li>


				<li><b>Are wealthier municipalities more likely to be dominated by single-family zoning? </b> I have two conflicting theories about this. On the one hand, richer towns might have the highest percentage of land zoned for single-family housing because restrictive zoning has historically been used to keep housing prices (and barriers to entry) high. But on the other hand, it’s possible that rich homeowners also have the resources to push for zoning exemptions that allow them to build what they want—meaning they could actually have more zoning flexibility. By mapping out income levels against zoning restrictions, we could get a better picture of whether zoning works in favor of wealthier areas or if it restricts everyone equally.</li>


				<li><b>How much more housing could we create if we rezoned single-family areas to allow multifamily housing?</b> Boston has a massive housing crisis, and it’s frustrating to see how much of the city is locked into zoning rules that don’t reflect the need for more housing. Growing up here, I heard so many stories about families struggling to afford to stay, and it always seemed like the city just wasn’t keeping up with demand. Given how much land is still zoned for single-family homes, I want to understand just how much housing potential we’re losing. If we rezoned even a portion of this land to allow multifamily housing, how many more homes could we actually build? Mapping this out could give a concrete sense of how much change is possible.</li>
