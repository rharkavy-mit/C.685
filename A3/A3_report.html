				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The main insight that I can glean from the chart as it is formatted is that Covid spikes in Winter months (January, top of the spiral). This intuitively makes sense from when Flu Season is, and is well visualized by the spiral, since you can see that the thicker portions happen in the same part of the year.</li>
				<li>The second thing that jumps out to me is how year on year the pandemic is worsening in terms of number of cases. January 2020 is significantly smaller than January 2021, which is smaller than January 2022. This seems to be indicating that the growth of Covid cases every January will continue into the future, which seems like it could be cause for some skepticism, since there is only two years of data to back it up.</li>
				<li>The last thing that I noticed is that the edges of the spiral aren't flat, but instead exhibit a bumpy sort of pattern, indicating that growth of the disease is not linear and potentially due to the 7 day moving average that they are depicting. If folks are most likely to get tested during the week, the 7 day average would be lower on weekends for instance.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>
						<ul>
<li>
Overall, this design does an effective job of indicating the seasonality and overall growth in magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is an origanl idea, and the spiral nature of the design reflects the cycle of a year and is likely intuitive to understand for most readers, especially of the New York Times. However there are noticeable flaws. The first, and most glaring omission, is cases of hospitalizations relative to total cases. In the context of the opinion article that it was attached to, hospitalization rates are LOWER for the 2022 Omicron variant than they were for prior variants. However, by looking at this graphic alone, the reader would likely infer that the situation was dire and immediate action should be taken to protect against catastrophe, which I suppose could be a reason the author intentionally omitted it. It would be fairly simple to have a different color secion of the spiral indicating hospitalizations as a percentage of new cases, which would give a clearer picture of where things are currently sitting. 
</li>
<li>
The second critique I have focuses more on the smaller design choices within the visualizations. I feel like the authors could have done a better job of labeling information on the graph, like the dates where Omicron and Delta variants began, and could have labeled magnitudes to make it more intuitive to the reader the scale we are speaking about at different points in time. They do have a key on the top left, but it is challenging for me to translate that scale to different places on the graph and get an accurate understanding of the case count. It is also hard for me to understand that we are supposed to start at the middle and follow the spiral outward. A label like "Start" or even a larger arrow pointing out from the middle would have been helpful to orient myself within the visualization. The small arrow doesn't draw your eyes as a viewer.
</li></ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The first rationale for this was that I wanted to make the spiral we stuied in part one better. Overall, I thought it was an innovate visualization and the mistakes they made, like not including hospitalization rates, were fixable. The purple here represents hospitalization numbers and red + purple represents total new cases. I think that the red + purple part was slightly unclear, and I could have dont a better job of distinguishing that the sum was total cases</li>
				<li>My other problem with the spiral was that there wasn't enough descriptive labeling around it. I added a few notes on what 100k cases looked like and when specific variants started. This had always felt like a timeline to me, and so adding descriptive markers along it made a lot of sense. I think if I had more information on Covid I could have added many more, and it still would have been effective.</li>
				<li>While I am pleased overall with how this turned out, I still think magnitude of cases is hard to quantify in this visualization. While we can see that they are growing, its challenging to compare time stamps that are not aligned with each other, and we can only see relative sizes, not hard numbers. This was my motivation for the next sketch, trying to make quantitative comparisons easier. However, I also knew I didn't want to lose the seasonality aspect of this visualization in my next version.</li>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>As mentioned, one of the things I liked the most about the first visualization was how clear seasonality was. I made the conscious decision here to use specific colors for each season (laid out in the top right). I think this does a good job of communicating to the viewer where in the year they are, since the x-axis is slightly convoluted with so many months. Maybe another way to do this would have been to stack the yearly bar charts on top of each other so the seasonality was even more clearly shown, but I think not having the bars sequential would have taken away from the effect of comparing them.</li>
				<li>Secondly, I wanted this visualization to be simple and easily understood. One of the critiques of the first visualization was that it could be hard to understand quantitites. I believe that bar graphs are one of the most intuitive types of visualization and it is very easy to see in this graphic the exact magnitudes of each wave.</li>
				<li>I tried to play around with creating a future projection here using the dotted purple lines on the far right.  While I like how they give the illusion of what is coming, it does indicate a certainty in  our future projection, which isn't actually the case. That is just the best guess based on past patterns. Maybe shading a cone would have been more effective here? </li>

          A Calendar Approach: New Covid Cases in the USA 2020-2022
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I was still stuck on the seasonality of this data, and wanted to make the timeline aspect of it intentionally really clear. I had the idea of trying a calendar and wanted to see if I could get it to communicate the data. Calendar's are a visual that everyone is comfortable looking at, so hopefully it is familiar to lay audiences.</li>
				<li>I wanted to deal with the problem of death rates in a better way than the spiral did. What was missing from the second visualization I drew was that things are actually getting better from a death standpoint, and I wanted to make that very clear. </li>
				<li>I also was increasingly interested in the concept of a dual axis. I knew what this was from my tableau tutorials, but had never integrated it into a sketch of my own. I think it works well here because it highlights that while case counts may be high, death / hospitalization counts are not, which is an important observation to avoid panic with this particular data set. I do regret not doing a better job of using color here, since it seems like a missed opportunity on such a unique type of visualization. The dual axis does do a good job of overlaying hopsitalization rates on top of the case counts, but color could have added a seasonality or even growth rate perspectiev to the data. </li>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>
			<p>
        For my final design, I wanted to highlight two things: the seasonality of Covid and the fact that while cases are increasing, deaths are going down. I was trying to put myself in the shoes of someone in January of 2022 and give them a visualization that highlights the severity of the case count without leading anyone to panic about their own impending doom. To do this, I focused on two metrics Deceased Counts and Confirmed Counts. I looked at them on a monthly basis across all three years in the data set and organized them so months was a column and years was a row. This allowed it to be very easy to intuitively look down a column and compare the same month across years. 
      </p>
      <p>

        The interesting thing I did was focus on growth rates in new cases, and death rates in new deaths. To do so, I calculated how much month to month growth was amongst cases/deaths. I originally had this as the final step, however the growth/death rates were so high in March of 2020 that I had to utilize a log scale, which worked great! I then used a red green color axis which allowed me to show red when the rates of growth or death were highest and green when they were decreasing most quickly. This allowed me to achieve my main goal of showing that for 2022 while cases were high, deaths were much lower, and they were decreasing more quickly than they had in the past. 
</p>
<p>
        I do have a few critiques of this design. I could have made the labels on my growth/death rates clearer. I also didn't like that it had the year first and then the new confirmed/new deceased breakdown. I wanted it to be New Confirmed first then broken down by year followed by new deceased, since its hard visually to differentiate between the deaths and confirmed cases. It didn't seem to work without creating a dashboard of each, which was out of bounds for this assignment. I also wonder if I should have used different color scales? I felt like red green was so intuitive here that red was bad for both, but maybe that would have allowed for easier differentiation.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I definitely felt some tension while trying to create this design. I had a really hard time balancing the case numbers, death numbers, growth rate and death rate into a cohesive visual that showed everything I wanted. The process made me appreciate how hard it must have been to come to the spiral visualization in the first place. I do think I did a good job of incorporating my learnings from my sketches. I think I could have done a better job of seasonality with distinct quarters marked off on the graph, which could have been a learning from visualization 2. But I do like that I took my learnings from Vis 1 and Vis 3 and incorporated deaths (instead of hospitalizations) into my final design. The challenge of showing two separate pieces of numerical data was apparent, and I couldn't make it look visually engaging on a dual axis, which I expected to be easy. I think if I went back and did the intial critique again, I would have been kinder to the origanl authors. My critique of highlighting critical points was also impossible to incorporate since my table did not allow for a straight trendline and only looked at months comparitively, which was a tradeoff on highlighting seasonality instead of giving the user more information
